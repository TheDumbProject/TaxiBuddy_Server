 # PostgreSQL Database Setup and Basic Operations
 
 This guide will help you set up a PostgreSQL database, initialize it with a schema and some data, and perform basic operations using PostgreSQL.
 
 ## Prerequisites
 
 - PostgreSQL installed on your system.
 - A command-line interface (CLI) like `psql` to interact with PostgreSQL.
 - Basic understanding of SQL and relational databases.
 
 ## Setup Instructions
 
 ### 1. Clone the Repository
 
 First, clone the repository containing the setup script:
 
 ```bash
 git clone https:github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
 cd your-repo
 ```
 
 ### 2. Run the Setup Script
 
 Execute the setup script to create the database, initialize the schema, and insert some initial data:
 
 ```bash
 psql -U postgres -f setup_db.sql
 ```
 
 Replace `postgres` with your PostgreSQL superuser name if it's different.
 
 ### 3. Access the Database
 
 After setting up, you can access the PostgreSQL database using:
 
 ```bash
 psql -U postgres -d your_database_name
 ```
 
 Replace `your_database_name` with the name of the database created by the setup script.
 
 ## Basic PostgreSQL Operations
 
 ### 1. List All Databases
 
 To view all databases on your PostgreSQL server:
 
 ```sql
 \l
 ```
 
 ### 2. Switch to a Specific Database
 
 If you want to switch to a different database:
 
 ```sql
 \c your_database_name
 ```
 
 ### 3. List All Tables
 
 To list all tables in the current database:
 
 ```sql
 \dt
 ```
 
 ### 4. View Table Schema
 
 To view the schema of a specific table:
 
 ```sql
 \d table_name
 ```
 
 ### 5. Query Data
 
 To retrieve data from a table:
 
 ```sql
 SELECT * FROM table_name;
 ```
 
 You can also write more complex queries to filter or sort data:
 
 ```sql
 SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition ORDER BY column1;
 ```
 
 ### 6. Insert Data
 
 To insert a new row into a table:
 
 ```sql
 INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2) VALUES ('value1', 'value2');
 ```
 
 ### 7. Update Data
 
 To update existing data in a table:
 
 ```sql
 UPDATE table_name SET column1 = 'new_value' WHERE condition;
 ```
 
 ### 8. Delete Data
 
 To delete data from a table:
 
 ```sql
 DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
 ```
 
 ### 9. Drop a Table
 
 To drop (delete) a table from the database:
 
 ```sql
 DROP TABLE table_name;
 ```
 
 ### 10. Exit the `psql` Interface
 
 To exit the PostgreSQL command-line interface:
 
 ```sql
 \q
 ```
 
 ## Troubleshooting
 
 - **Authentication Issues**: Ensure you have the correct username and password. If youâ€™re using a different user, replace `postgres` with your username.
 - **Connection Issues**: Make sure the PostgreSQL service is running. You can start it with `sudo service postgresql start` on most Linux systems.
 - **Permission Denied**: Ensure your PostgreSQL user has the necessary permissions to create databases, tables, etc.
